# About

`Spotify Music Quiz` was largely inspired by [Deezer's music quiz](https://www.deezer.com/explore/fr/features/music-quiz/), on which Gr√©goire used to beat me when we played.

The idea was above all to have a free zone of expression where I could discover new things (including `Flask` and the `Spotify API`) and not particularly do anything technically impressive.

Also, I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create the *animations*.

## Some TODOs

* Tell the user that the room already exists
* Allow the user to choose which playlist to play on
* Create a `404.html` template with a fun gif !
* Deploy
* Win/loss animation
* Multiplayer
* More tests
